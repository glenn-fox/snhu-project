In order for the program to be considered functional or secure, it will need to be tested. Different tests will see if the program is functional or if it is secure
The user needs hopfully will not require much interpreting. You should be able to see what is needed and find a way to incorperate that into the program. Then tests can be written to make sure the requirments are met.
Approaching writing software, I usually take it one step at a time. I get the problem, then break it down into smaller peices. Then solve each smaller problem  until the full problem is solved. Then, time permiting, I refactor the code to make it more clean. For example, if two smaller problems can be solved together then I merge them.
